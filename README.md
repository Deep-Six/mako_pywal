# Introduction
This is a quick script to generate a mako config from a pywal color scheme.
It's relatively light on dependencies and is pretty prompt. 

## Installation
Simply copy this to somewhere in your `$PATH` I used `$HOME/bin`

## Usage 
This script can be called using pywal's `wal -o "script_name"` option or any
other script you use to call wal with.
